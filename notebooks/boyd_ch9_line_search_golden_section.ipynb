    "So, let's load the function from the source file and take a look at it. (It's loaded in the cell below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to mention is a 'design' choice I made. The function for golden section seach and backtracking search should expose a similar interface. That is, a function designed to call one of them should also work when calling the other. For now I have decided that the functions should return a dictionary, containing `'t'`, the step size, and `'x'`, the value of $x + t\\Delta x$. Offloading this responsibility to the line search functions means that a function which uses them does not need to care whether it is calling a line search method that calculates an optimum $x^*$ (like golden section search) or a recommended step size $t$ (like backtracking) since all line search functions will by design return both.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define the constants we will be using in each iteration of the search: $\\varphi^{-1}$ and $\\varphi^{-2}$. We also initialise a counter `nfev` which will track how many function evaluations the line search performs. This is a very important statistic in many cases. In order to actually keep track of the function evaluations we wrap `func` inside another function `_f`, which increments this counter before returning `func(x)`. I don't know if this is particularly \"pythonic\", but it seems like a good way to do it. It creates an extra stack frame, but if that kind of detail is going to make or break your solution I doubt python is the right tool for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now at `_gs`, which is where the actual line search will occur. Why should we create this \"hidden\" function instead of just making `goldensection` the recursive line search function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if a function wishes to utilise backtracking line search it should provide a starting point and a search direction. Golden section search is not derived in the same way! Golden section search requires an interval containing a minimum. If we wish the two functions to be interchangable we must address this disparity. Furthermore `_gs` must be able to take a whole list of arguments, $x_2$, $x_3$, $fx_2$, $fx_3$ which a caller is unlikely to be able to provide anyway. So, we wrap up `_gs` and hide the details from the caller so that it is more easliy interchangeable with a backtracking line search function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you follow the pseudocode we wrote earlier you will see that `_gs` is defined exactly as we discussed with one small exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```if np.linalg.norm(h) <= precision: return (x1 + x4) / 2```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why take the norm of `h` instead of just using `h` directly? Although line search occurs in one dimension, we are usually interested in $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, so we need to be a little cognisant of any points in our implementation where the fact that $x$ may be a numpy array may be relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last few lines bracket the minimum (very lazily). This is enclosed in a `for`-`else` loop that will raise an error if we fail to bracket the minimum within a reasonable time. We then call `_gs` to find the minimum. When we return our result the line `'t': np.average((xopt - x) / dx)` is a bit of a hack. $(x^*-x) / \\Delta x$ should in principle be exactly $t\\mathbf{1}$, but I decided to take an average just in case of some precision loss on one of the entries. This may prove to be a bad idea. We will find out in testing!"

    "### Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "I remember the discomfort of learning to use recursion and the endless errors, stack overflows, and memory leaks that came with it. I have friends and colleagues that have been programming for a few years and still would rather die on the hill of multiply-nested loops several times before even considering a recursive algorithm. To be clear they are not developers or software engineers, so this is by no means unforgivable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By all means, it is possible to write a recursive algorithm for problems that are not well-suited to such a formulation and I suspect that some of the bad experiences of learning to use recursion might come from such examples where recursion created unnecessary complexity. That said, some structures and problems are \"inherently\" recursive and recognising them as such can often simplify them, rather than complicate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find the lines `return _gs(x1, x3, h=h*iphi, x3=x2, fx3=fx2)` and `return _gs(x2, x4, h=h*iphi, x2=x3, fx2=fx3)` intimidating because the function `_gs` calls itself in its return statement then perhaps a little time spent learning about recursion will help.\n",
    "\n",
    "I may create some notes on the topic at a later date and they will be linked here once they exist. In the meantime I think this [medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/brief-introduction-to-recursion-8ea409b5f1bf) is a good introductory read."
