# Optimisation

This repo is intended to be an instructive collection of optimisation algorithms, following the book "Convex Optimisation" by Stephan Boyd.

Algorithms can be found in the `/src` folder. Demonstrations using the algorithms and explanations of their function in jupyter notebooks can be found in the `/notebooks` folder. The `/plotting` folder contains functions for creating explanatory plots for the notebooks, and users are note expected to have to interact with these implementations to understand the optimisation algorithms.

At the moment the focus will be on implementing algorithms in Python, as such, no additions to the explanatory notebooks are expected in the short-term.
